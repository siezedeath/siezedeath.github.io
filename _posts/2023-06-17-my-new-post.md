This post is just going to be a little about my life and how I got to where I am today. :D

## My Journey

My math journey started out in middle school with the AMC 8 (American Math Competiton). I was never really succesful with math competitions until I found a competitive community in high school. After my sophomore year of high school, I attended a program over the summer which expanded on my problem solving skills and took a Calculus course with that. The following fall, my teacher Mr. Sterr developed my passion for math in such a way that I never thought possible and I found myself investing hours of my own time learning and solving problems. 

Shortly after, I found myself taking and passing all sorts of competitive exams such as the AMC 12, the AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination), and even qualifying for the USAMO (United States of America Mathematical Olympiad). My dream had come through after years of hard work and I continue to share the same passion and motivation I had with people around me.

While being involved with math competitions, my peers around introduced what is known as the USACO (United States of America Computing Olympiad), and although I never really participated, it got me into coding. I really developed a passion starting the summer after my freshman year of college and I developed a small Tic-Tac-Toe game with Java. I also took an Analysis of Algorithms course the fall after and my professor Rezaul A. Chowdhury helped develop my passion for computer science, especially with dynamic programming and several different graph algorithms.

With these projects, combined with my passion for trading stock derivatives (mainly options), I developed an interest for high frequency trading firms. At the time, while not being sure what 'algorithmic-trading' is, I used my knowledge of python's data and math libraries as well as financial indicators to develop a trading bot. This really began my journey towards learning more about financial markets and how probability theory and algorithms and be applied such.

Currently, I work at Synergy Prep, a tutoring center, where I have the opportunity to share my knowledge and expertise. I employ diverse approaches to help students tackle different mathematical problems. Before diving into lessons, I engage students by presenting puzzles and brain teasers, which stimulates their critical thinking skills. Witnessing their active participation and collaborative problem-solving efforts makes me happy. I also work at a high frequency trading firm known as Hudson River Trading (HRT for short), and working through financial markets using mathematics and computer science is by far the most gratifying application I have come across thus far.
